        <p class = "container"> My name is Matthew Castillo. I am a new graduate from <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/ ">CSUSB</a> with a Computer Science degree,</a> I am going to be pursuing my passion for Computer Science/Cyber Security and master my craft for it. I became interested in Computer Science back in 2017 when I was a Sophmore in Highschool, it was around then when they announced a computer science class, which to my excitement, I enrolled in it. With that class, I learned the basics of HTML and C++. As of currently, I am learning more about JavaScript. <br><br> I first started attending CSUSB back in 2020 for my Computer Science degree. After taking many classes that has to do with coding, I began to try to learn how to code on my own time which led to me know the basics of Python. Throughout my college career, I learned coding languages such as Python, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am planning to continue how to code in other languages and how I can be a better Programmer.<br><br> My current interests are in the Cyber Security field such as a SOC or a Pentester. My overall goals in my life is to be able to defend and stop intruders from breaking into company sites and finding vulnerabilities to stop the problem. <br><br> Always motivated to learn new information and to become proficient enough for the job at hand. </p>
